# Rfast2
A collection of Rfast2 functions for data analysis.  Note 1: The vast majority of the functions accept matrices only, not data.frames.  Note 2: Do not have matrices or vectors with have missing data (i.e NAs). We do no check about them and C++ internally transforms them into zeros (0), so you may get wrong results. Note 3: In general, make sure you give the correct input, in order to get the correct output. We do no checks and this is one of the many reasons we are fast.
